# Employee Classification
## Exempt and Non-Exempt
Exempt Employees - Exempt employees are those that are excluded from the overtime pay requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Exempt employees are paid a salary and are expected to work beyond their normal work hours whenever necessary to accomplish the work of the company. Exempt employees are not eligible to receive overtime compensation. Employees should consult with HR if they have questions regarding their classification as an exempt employee.

Non-exempt Employees - (typically those earning minimum wage or without specialized training) are eligible for overtime pay of 1.5 times the regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 per work week. All overtime must be approved in advance by your supervisor.

## Part Time, Full Time or Temporary Status
Part-time or full-time status depends on the number of hours per week an employee works. Employees who regularly work fewer than 40 hours per week receive part-time classification. Part-time employees are not eligible for employee benefits as described in this handbook.

From time to time the company may hire employees for specific projects or periods of time, or as interns. Temporary employees and interns may work either part-time or full-time, but are scheduled to terminate by a certain date. Temporary employees are not eligible for employment benefits.

# Work Schedule
## Work Hours
Voltage, LLC follows a work schedule of 40 hours per week. The normal workweek is Monday through Friday from 8am to 5pm. Your supervisor or manager may establish alternative hours.

## Attendance & Punctuality
Every employee is expected to attend work regularly and report to work on time. If you are unable to report to work on time for any reason, telephone or email your supervisor as far in advance as possible, but no later than the start of your shift. If you do not communicate an absence in advance, it will be considered unexcused.

Unsatisfactory attendance, including reporting late or quitting early, may be cause for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

## Flexible Work Hours & Telecommuting
Flexible work arrangements and telecommuting require written approval from your supervisor, provide your job and department are suited for it.

With a manager's approval, you may be allowed to begin and end your workday earlier or later than established hours. Telecommuting requires the approval of a Company officer. To maintain a flexible work arrangement, employees must ensure business needs are met and adhere to attendance and punctuality policies. Such arrangements may be established, changed or discontinued at the Company's discretion.

# Compensation
## General Pay Information
Certain deductions will be made in accordance with federal and state laws. In addition, the Company may make available certain voluntary deductions as part of the Company’s benefits program. If an employee elects supplemental coverage under one of the Company's benefits plans, which requires employee contributions, the employee's share of the cost will be deducted from his or her check each pay period. If the employee is not receiving a payroll check due to illness, injury, or leave of absence, he or she will be required to pay the monthly cost directly to the Company.

Time-keeping is required of all employees, and can be submitted through the Company’s web-based time-keeping program. Other methods may be approved by your supervisor. Hours worked must be reported to your supervisor no later than the 15th and the last day of each month. Currently, paychecks are released 5 days after your time is reported. For payroll purposes, time is rounded to the nearest quarter of an hour.

Please report any change in name, address, contact information, marital status or number of exemptions claimed to HR.

## Overtime
Because of the nature of work, salaried employees may be asked to work overtime on weekends or holidays or additional hours during the regular workday and are expected to comply with such requests. Voltage will strive to ensure that this does not happen on a regular basis.

Overtime compensation is paid to all hourly employees at one and one-half times their straight time rate for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week.

If you are nonexempt, you must receive authorization from your manager before working overtime. And after you have worked overtime, you must enter it on a timesheet by the day after it is accrued.

Overtime pay is based on actual hours worked. Time taken for lunch or dinner is not included as time worked for purposes of computing overtime. And time-off on holidays, sick leave, vacation leave, personal leave, training seminars or any leave of absence will not be factored in as hours worked when calculating overtime.

## Pay Schedule
Employees will be twice monthly. If the regular payday falls on a holiday, payday will be the regular workday after the holiday.

The pay week starts at the beginning of your shift on Monday and includes all work you perform up to the close of business on Sunday. Any overtime earnings will be paid one week following the actual hours worked. If a paycheck is lost or stolen, notify your supervisor immediately.

## Performance Evaluations and Salary Increases
Supervisors and employees are strongly encouraged to discuss job performance and goals informally any time. Additional formal performance reviews will be conducted to provide both supervisors and employees with the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct weaknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for meeting goals. These formal reviews will be conducted at least once every 12 months.

Wage reviews are conducted for each employee, and salary increases are based on those reviews, as well as our profitability. However, an employee receiving a performance appraisal will not necessarily receive a salary increase. Raises are not guaranteed.

## Outside Employment
Because of Voltage, LLC's obligations to its customers, the Company must be aware of any concurrent employment you may have to determine whether or not it presents a potential conflict. In general, outside employment is permitted as long as it does not conflict in any way with the employee’s responsibilities, or presents a conflict of interest, as described above.

Before beginning or continuing outside employment, employees are required to inform their manager in writing (email is acceptable) detailing their involvement with the other employer and to obtain the written approval of their managers. Failing to obtain prior approval as described may be cause for disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Employees who are on leave of absence, including FMLA leave or Workers' Compensation leave are prohibited from having outside employment during their leave. Serving on any public or government board or commission qualifies as employment for purposes of this policy, regardless of whether such service is compensated.

## Family Medical Leave (FMLA)
You are eligible for family and medical leave if you have worked for Voltage, LLC for at least 12 months and have put in at least 1,250 hours (not including vacations, holidays or sick leave) during the 12 month period before the leave is to begin. However, as a small company with under 50 employees, Voltage is not required by law to offer FMLA, and this benefit may be rescinded for all employees without advance notice.

### Reasons for the Leave
You are entitled to take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave:
- To attend to the birth, adoption or foster care placement of your child
- To attend to the serious health condition of your child, spouse or parent, or
- To receive care for your own serious health condition.

A serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition during which you are incapable of working that involves:
>Treatment requiring inpatient care in a hospital, hospice or residential care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition that lasts more than three consecutive days, or for pregnancy or prenatal care or for a chronic health condition which continues over an extended period of time, requires periodic visits to a health care provider and may involve occasional episodes of incapacity, such as serious asthma or diabetes.

It also includes a permanent or long-term condition such as Alzheimer's, a severe stroke and terminal cancer. In addition, leave may be used to cover absences due to multiple treatments for restorative surgery or for a condition which would likely make you incapable of working for more than three days if not treated, such as chemotherapy or radiation treatments for cancer.

### Substituting Paid Leave
You must use all accrued personal time off for family and medical leave. Your total FMLA leave time, which may include paid vacation and sick time, may not exceed 12 weeks. The Company has the right to designate such leaves as running concurrently with FMLA leave.

### Types of Leave
Leave due to the birth or placement of a child in your home for adoption or foster care must be taken in one continuous 12-week segment and must be taken within 12 months of the birth or placement of the child.

You may take leave due to your own or a family member’s serious health condition in:
- One continuous 12 week segment
- An intermittent schedule, such as one day off each week, or
- A reduced schedule, such as beginning two hours late, twice a week.

### Notice of Leave
If your need for leave is foreseeable, you must give 30 days prior notice if possible. If you do not give such notice, the leave may be delayed for up to 30 days. If your need for leave is due to a planned medical treatment, make every attempt to schedule the treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the work of your department. If your need for leave is not foreseeable, you must request it as soon as practicable, no later than two business days after the need for leave arises.

### Medical Certification
If leave is requested due to your own or a family member's serious health condition, you must provide medical certification from an appropriate health care provider. The medical certification must include the date on which the condition began and its probable duration. You may be denied leave if you do not provide satisfactory certification. Voltage, LLC may also require a second opinion or third opinion regarding certification of a serious health condition, at our expense.

### Returning to Work
If your leave is due to your own medical condition, you are required to provide medical certification that you are able to resume work before returning. Both you and your health care provider must complete a Return to Work Medical

### Certification.
Upon returning to work, you will ordinarily be entitled to be restored to your former position or to an equivalent position with the same employment benefits and pay if possible. If you do not return to work at the end of the leave and do not notify Voltage, LLC of your status, you may be terminated.

### Benefits During Leave
Voltage, LLC will maintain your insurance benefits while you are on leave, although you will be required to pay your portion of the premium. You may make arrangements in advance with the HR department. If you do not return to work after the leave, you may be asked to reimburse us for the cost of maintaining insurance coverage during the leave. This provision will not apply in cases where your inability to return is through no fault of your own -- for example, at the end of leave you remain physically unable to return due to your serious health condition.

If you intentionally misrepresent the reasons for requesting family and medical leave, you may be discharged.

## Military Leave
Pursuant to the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), Voltage, LLC prohibits discrimination against persons because of their service in the Armed Forces, the Army National Guard and the Air Force National Guard when engaged in active duty for training, inactive duty training, or full-time National Guard duty, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and any other category of persons designated by the President in time of war or emergency. Employees who are members of the National Guard or U.S. reserves can take up to 15 days of paid leave per year when called for training or duty. If additional leave time is required, it will be unpaid.

## Jury Duty
Voltage, LLC supports employees in fulfilling their civic responsibilities by serving jury duty when required and will compensate you $50 per day for the first three days of jury service. You will not be paid your regular wages on days that you cannot come to work due to jury duty. You must inform your supervisor of your jury summons as soon as possible so that arrangements can be made to accommodate your absence. If you can report for work during your jury service you will be paid your regular wages, on an hourly basis. Insurance benefits will remain in effect and unchanged for the full term of your jury duty absence.

# General Employment
## Introductory (Probationary) Period
The first 60 days of employment are an Introductory Period for both the employee and the Company. (However, both during and after this period, the work relationship will remain at will.) The Introductory Period may be extended at management's discretion.

This time period allows you to determine if you have made the right career decision and for Voltage, LLC to determine whether your initial work performance meets our needs. Your manager will monitor your work performance, attitude and attendance during this time, and be available to answer any questions or concerns you may have about your new job. Benefits such as time off for vacation, personal days, or sick day do not accrue during this period. However, probationary employees will be paid for Company holidays that occur during their first 60 days.

## Termination or Resignation
Unless expressly proscribed by statute or contract, employment with Voltage, LLC is "at will" and may be terminated with or without cause or notice. Similarly, employees are free to resign at any time. If an employee resigns, Voltage, LLC requests the courtesy of at least two weeks notice.

Any employee who is discharged by Voltage, LLC shall be paid wages and vacation accrued to the date of the separation.

## Termination
Employment with the company is on an at-will basis and may be terminated voluntarily or involuntarily at any time. Upon termination, an employee is required to return all files, computers, laptops, equipment, keys, access cards, software or other property belonging to the company that are in the employee’s possession, custody or control. The employee may also be requested to participate in an exit interview upon termination.

Under Colorado law, VOLTAGE, LLC must immediately issue a final paycheck to a terminated employee, or within six (6) hours of the beginning of the next business day if the payroll office is closed. Additionally, if the payroll office is offsite, then the employer must issue the final paycheck to the terminated employee within twenty-four (24) hours of his or her termination. An employee who quits his or her job is not entitled to a final paycheck until the next regularly scheduled pay date. Should the employee be unable to personally retrieve their paycheck, it will be mailed to the address on file.

## Permissible Deductions Upon Termination
Voltage may deduct from the final paycheck the amount of money or the value of property that the employee failed to properly return to the employer. In this instance the employer shall have ten (10) calendar days after the termination of employment to audit and adjust the accounts and property value of any items entrusted to the employee before the employee's wages or compensation shall be paid.

Employees should be aware that the illegal duplication of software may result in the filing of criminal copyright charges by the owners of the copyrights and can subject both the employee and the company to liability. You may not load personal software on Voltage, LLC computers.

## Use of Company Communication Systems
Because Voltage, LLC reserves the right to access any personal communication without prior notice, employees should not use company systems to transmit any messages or to access any information that they would not want a third party to hear or see. Although incidental and occasional personal use of the company's systems is permitted, any such personal use will be treated the same as all other communications under this policy. However, employees are at all times prohibited from accessing or downloading information from the Internet for personal use. Personal email is allowed as long as employees are productive, and does not interfere or violate standards.

Employees are reminded that they should have no expectation of privacy in their use of company computers or other electronic equipment.

Voltage, LLC may periodically monitor the usage of the telephone systems to ensure compliance with this policy.

##Company Property
Please keep your work area neat and clean and use normal care in handling company property. Report any broken or damaged equipment to your manager at once so that proper repairs can be made. You may be given computer or other type of equipment as required by your job. A separate form acknowledging receipt and care for this equipment may be issued, requiring your signature.

# Employee Benefits
## Employee Benefits
Voltage, LLC employees are entitled to benefits. A number of the benefit programs -- such as Social Security, workers' compensation, state disability and unemployment insurance -- cover all employees as required by law, and are administered through payroll deductions.

We reserve the right to add, amend, modify or terminate any employee benefit plans or programs.

All Expense Report Forms should be submitted to your supervisor no later than five business days after the last day of the month.

## Worker's Compensation

# Holidays and Paid Time Off
## Holidays
Voltage, LLC observes several holidays throughout the year. A list is provided to all employees each year, and you may contact HR for the list. You will be paid for these holidays if you are a full-time employee who has worked at least 1 day at the Company, and unless time off has been approved in advance as vacation or personal days. Holidays that fall on a weekend will be observed either on a Friday or Monday. Due to business needs, some employees may be required to work on company holidays. Your supervisor or manager will notify you if this may apply to you.

## Paid Time Off (PTO)
Active, full-time employees are eligible for paid time off (PTO), which can be used for vacation, personal days, appointments or illness. Part-time employees are not eligible for PTO.

After 6 months of continuous full-time employment, you are entitled to use your PTO. PTO accrues at a rate of 24 hours per quarter, totaling 96 hours per year (equivalent to 12 days). After 5 years of employment, you are entitled to 144 hours of PTO per year (equivalent to 18 days). PTO may rollover year to year, but shall not exceed 3 weeks in any given 12 month period. All PTO must be earned before being taken, and you may not substitute pay for unused time. You may take PTO in 4 hour increments (half-day) but not less.

Voltage, LLC requests two weeks advance notice for all time off, and reserves the right to refuse permission for time off if it will interfere with Company operations or adversely affect coverage of job and staff requirements. Whenever possible, employees' requests for vacation will be accommodated, but where scheduling conflicts arise, seniority will prevail.

## Additional Time-Off
VOLTAGE discourages time-off other than described in this document, because it negatively impacts company productivity. However, circumstances arise that may require employees to take additional time-off for health or other personal or family reasons. These days must be taken *without pay*, and shall not exceed 5 days per year without prior written approval from your supervisor.

# Additional Policies
The company may, from time to time, issue a new Employee Handbook, which all employees will receive. In addition, any issues or concerns not addressed here will be handled on an individual basis by company officers and/or its attorneys, as deemed necessary.
